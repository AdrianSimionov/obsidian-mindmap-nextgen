## Usage

Open the command palette (cmd/ctrl-p) and begin typing the name of one of the 2 commands.

What's the difference between a pinned and an unpinned mindmap? A pinned mindmap is linked to a single Markdown document. An unpinned mindmap will update based on whichever document is the last one you clicked on.

You can also insert mindmaps inside your document using a Markdown code block tagged with "markmap". For example:

~~~
```markmap
# Mindmap
## Mindmap
```
~~~


## "More options" menu

This is the menu in the top right of each tab.

### Pin/Unpin

Switch the tab to unpinned, or pin it to the active document.

### Copy screenshot

Copy a PNG of the mindmap to the clipboard.
Background and text color are configurable in settings or the document's frontmatter.

### Collapse all

Closes all mindmap nodes, leaving just the root visible

### Toggle toolbar

Show or hide the toolbar in the bottom right of the mindmap


## Other Features

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes will be displayed in the mindmap like so:

```
# Housework
## Main
- [x] Dishes
- [ ] Cleaning the bathroom
- [x] Change the light bulbs
- [ ] something else
## [x] Also works on titles
```

### LaTeX
LaTex expressions will be rendered in your mindmaps. Surround an inline expression with a dollar sign on either side.

`$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}$`

Or use two dollar signs for a multiline expression.
```
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
$$
```


## Frontmatter

Some settings can be set in each document's frontmatter. Frontmatter settings take precedence over global settings, when set.

The plugin will use any of [markmap's settings](https://markmap.js.org/docs/json-options) except for `extraJs` and `extraCss`).

**Example:**
```markdown
---
markmap:
  screenshotTextColor: #28F48D
  highlight: true
  titleAsRootNode: true
---
```


## Settings

### Coloring approaches
There are three approaches to coloring the branches of the mindmap for you to choose from, either in plugin settings or each document's frontmatter.

#### Branch coloring
This mode will choose random different colors per branch. The "Color freeze level" setting decides at what depth the branches will stop picking new colors.

#### Depth coloring
In this mode, branches are coloured depending on their depth level. In your plugin settings, you can choose the first three levels' colors, plus a default color for levels deeper than three.

#### Single color
In this mode, all branches are colored with a single color, which you can choose in your plugin settings.

#### Branch thickness
Regardless which coloring approach you choose, you can set branch thickness for the first three depth levels, and a default thickness for levels beyond that.


### Highlight inline markmaps

Frontmatter setting: `highlight`

Add a background to inline markmaps to make them stand out from the rest of the page.


### Use title as root node

Frontmatter setting: `titleAsRootNode`

Generate mindmaps with the title at the bottom level, so you can avoid repeating the title.


### Screenshot settings

Frontmatter settings: `screenshotTextColor`, `screenshotBgColor`

Decide what colors the screenshot function will use.

Take screenshots via the ["More options" menu](#more-options-menu).


## Installing

Search for "Mindmap NextGen" in the Community Plugins section in your Obsidian settings.
